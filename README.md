# KanaReader
Deep Learning model that recognize kana

---

I created this project to practice deep learning using Tensorflow.

---

## Dataset used 

I used the [7500-unique-kana-image](https://github.com/Orzelius/7500-unique-kana-images) dataset to train the model.

The model have 98.37% accuracy.

## Scripts

There is also 2 script written in python to put each kana in the corresponding folder and to create a validation dataset.
