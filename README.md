## Training

- I used the [7500-unique-kana-image](https://github.com/Orzelius/7500-unique-kana-images) dataset to train the model.

- The code to train the model is **kanaReader.ipynb** notebook

## Scripts

I created 2 python scripts : 
- One to put each kana in the folder of his category
- One to create a validation dataset
